# MATLAB Soil Bearing Capacity Predictor

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built in MATLAB to predict the bearing capacity of spread footings in soil based on geotechnical parameters.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
- **Problem:** Predicting soil bearing capacity is crucial for foundation design in civil engineering. However, accurate predictions of the bearing capacity require full-scale load tests that are usually very expensive, or model foundations plate load tests which are less expensive yet less accurate, or bearing capacity theories which the least expensive at the cost of accuracy.
- **Solution:** Developed a machine learning model using MATLAB's Neural Network Toolbox that takes soil parameters as input and outputs bearing capacity predictions, presenting itself as an optimal solution for the problem: a cheap yet accurate method of bearing capacity predictions.
- **Result:** Model achieved 96% accuracy/RÂ² score on test data.
